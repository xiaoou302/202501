# Cognifex - Project Overview

## Game Concept
Cognifex is a logic puzzle game inspired by alchemy. It features a **two-stage gameplay loop**:
1. **The Study (书房)** - Zero-penalty logic puzzle solving phase
2. **The Laboratory (实验室)** - High-stakes execution phase with one chance to succeed

## Core Theme
The game uses alchemical symbolism throughout. Players must decipher a mentor's encrypted journal to determine the correct sequence of 12 alchemy steps, then execute them perfectly in the laboratory.

## Key Game Rules
- **Two-Stage Law**: Must complete Study phase (lock recipe) before entering Laboratory
- **Mercy of the Study**: Stage 1 has no failure - players can experiment freely
- **Laboratory's Judgment**: Stage 2 allows only ONE attempt. Any mistake causes immediate catastrophic failure
- **Victory Condition**: Successfully execute all 12 steps in the correct sequence

## Project Constraints
- **NO** freezed package or part syntax
- Use `setState` for state management
- Use `shared_preferences` for data storage
- NO local image assets (assets/images/)
- NO cached_network_image package
- NO account/authentication features
- NO external custom fonts (use system fonts only)
- Language: **English only**
- Platform: Mobile (iOS/Android)
